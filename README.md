# 🛡️ Keylogger Detector

A lightweight Python-based tool that detects and blocks potential keylogger activity on a local system using process scanning and signature-based detection.

---

## 📌 Project Description

Keyloggers are malicious programs that record keyboard inputs to steal sensitive information like passwords and credit card numbers. This project helps detect such threats by:

- Scanning running processes.
- Matching them against known keylogger signatures.
- Alerting the user or terminating suspicious processes.

---

## 🎯 Features

- 🔍 Real-time process scanning.
- 🧠 Signature-based detection for common keyloggers.
- 🚫 Option to terminate suspicious processes.
- 📄 Log generation for auditing and review.
- 🔐 Lightweight and fully offline – no data leaves your system.

---

## 🧠 Concepts Used

- Process and memory analysis using `psutil`.
- Static signature matching (name, behavior).
- Basic heuristic checks for keylogging behavior.
- Secure logging and user alerting.

---

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.7+
- OS: Windows / Linux / macOS

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/keylogger-detector.git
   cd keylogger-detector
````

2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Run the detector:

   ```bash
   python detector.py
   ```

---

## ⚙️ How It Works

1. **Process Scanner** – Iterates through running processes.
2. **Signature Matcher** – Compares process names and known behaviors.
3. **Heuristic Checker** – Flags hidden or suspicious processes (e.g., no window, long runtime).
4. **Response** – Logs the result and optionally terminates flagged processes.

## 📖 Example Output

```bash
[!] Suspicious process detected:
    Name: keylog32.exe
    PID: 1432
    Action: Terminated

[+] Scan complete. 1 threat removed. Log saved to logs/2025-07-03.log
