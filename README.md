# 🛡️ Keylogger Detector

A lightweight Python-based tool that detects and blocks potential keylogger activity on a local system using process scanning and signature-based detection.

---

## 📌 Project Description

Keyloggers are malicious programs that record keyboard inputs to steal sensitive information like passwords and credit card numbers. This project helps detect such threats by:

- Scanning running processes.
- Matching them against known keylogger signatures.
- Alerting the user or terminating suspicious processes.

---

## 🎯 Features

- 🔍 Real-time process scanning.
- 🧠 Signature-based detection for common keyloggers.
- 🚫 Option to terminate suspicious processes.
- 📄 Log generation for auditing and review.
- 🔐 Lightweight and fully offline – no data leaves your system.

---

## 🧠 Concepts Used

- Process and memory analysis using `psutil`.
- Static signature matching (name, behavior).
- Basic heuristic checks for keylogging behavior.
- Secure logging and user alerting.
